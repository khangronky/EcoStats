            At EcoStats, our mission is straightforward: to make it easy for everyone - from governments and scientists
            to
            regular folks
            - to look at how the temperature of the ocean and land has changed over years.
            We believe data is a super useful tool to understand things and get people to take action.
            So, we made a website where you can check out different facts and info about temperatures in different
            countries in a simple way.
            Our goal is to help all kinds of people, whether you just want a quick overview or a deep dive into the
            details.
            By sharing our info and ideas, we hope to get people interested, talking, and working together.
            Together, we can do things that make a real difference and keep our planet safe for the future.
